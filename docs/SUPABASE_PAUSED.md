# Supabase Project Paused - Quick Fix

If Supabase isn't responding, your project is likely **paused**. Free tier projects pause after 7 days of inactivity.

## Fix It (Takes 1-2 minutes)

1. Go to **[Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)**
2. Click your **project** (the one for Sapph)
3. Look for a banner that says **"Project paused"** or a **"Restore"** button
4. Click **"Restore"**
5. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for the project to wake up
6. Try your app again

## How to Tell If It's Paused

- Requests timeout (no response after 30+ seconds)
- "Signing you in..." screen hangs forever
- Onboarding "Finish" button times out
- Test Supabase page shows timeout errors

## After Restoring

Once restored, your app should work normally. The first request might take 10-30 seconds (project is waking up), but subsequent requests will be fast.

## Prevent Pausing (Paid Plans)

Free tier projects pause automatically. To prevent pausing:
- Upgrade to a paid plan (projects stay active 24/7)
- Or just restore when needed (it's free and takes 1-2 minutes)
